- 👋 Hi, I’m @matt-platts, a full stack web developer since 1998, and more recently devops engineer, with coding experience dataing back to ZX81s in 1983 when I used to try and write simple games in 1k!

- 👀 I’m interested in programming, full stack web development, APIs, a huge fan of old school Perl and modern javascript tech alike!

- 🌱 I’m currently using Python, React, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Kubernetes and a whole bunch more besides.

- 💞️ I enjoy collaborating on fun projects!
